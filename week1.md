## User Stories
* As a grocery retailer at Costco, I received an FDA notification that the pineapple fried rice  that came in three days ago is polluted by a fatal virus. I immediately stopped selling the product and sent all the remaining ones to the authorities. 
* A mother goes to grocery store and buys produce. She then goes home and puts food away. She uses the food over the next two weeks to feed her family. The FDA then issues a recall on an item she bought. How is she supposed to become aware of this issue?
