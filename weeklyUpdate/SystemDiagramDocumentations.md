# System Diagram Components 
## FDA recall data base
* [Immediate relase](http://www.fda.gov/Safety/Recalls/default.htm): 
 Pros: Updated at the moment of issue. Has pictures.  
 Cons:Data pattern varies for each entry. Would be hard for scraping.
* [Weekly report] (http//www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/ires/index.cfm): Updated weekly. 
 Well organized but need to download CSV file to see.
* [official API](https://open.fda.gov/food/enforcement/reference/):The API team is still active on [twitter](https://twitter.com/openFDA).
