## System Diagram 
* *Actors*:
FDA, Farmers,Packaging, Manufacturing, Food Companies, Other Corporations, Transportation, Storage, Restaurants, Grocery Stores, Bloomberg content source, Buyers Family, Insurance, Border Control, Databases, Central Database, Media, Grocery Buyers, Doctors, Law Enforcement, Lawyers, Waste Removal, Schools
* Components and Objects: Machine, Virus, Profit, Reputation, Cars, Refrigerator, Factory, Probability f Poison Data
Probability of illness given poison data, common risky foods database, Insurance, Treatment, Receipts (from Hospitals), Hospital Records and Reports, Lawsuits (against corporations, farmers, etc..) database, Documents from lawyers, notification, communication of issue, Analysis --> what? Affected consumer database, Reporting, Medical treatment, Central Databases
* How might we:
 * Get better quality control?** Send notifications faster?
 * Be more persuasive?
 * Target influenced buyers?
 * Detect food hazard before consumption?
 * use data to let hospitals know of the medical inventory they should have when patient enters?
 * reduce probability of incidence in restaurants and grocery stores?
 * use sensors and chemistry to decrease incidence of and detect problems in packaging?
 * break beurocratic barriers to get the data we need?
 * stop food from being polluted?
 * buy information from media?
 * inform customers of product recalls around the world real time?

## Possible Wedges
* pressure from media x
* packaging x
* social nudges x
* behavioral economics
* simple information display / UX / Usability
* Receipts (after the fact?)
* existing databases 
* consumer emails and texts
* competition among the customers
* speed

## User Stories
* As a grocery retailer at Costco, I received an FDA notification that the pineapple fried rice  that came in three days ago is polluted by a fatal virus. I immediately stopped selling the product and sent all the remaining ones to the authorities. 
* A mother goes to grocery store and buys produce. She then goes home and puts food away. She uses the food over the next two weeks to feed her family. The FDA then issues a recall on an item she bought. How is she supposed to become aware of this issue?
* I’m an officer of FDA and just receive a information that ‘ItemX’ sold in Queen and Brooklyn on ‘DateX’ is actually ‘defective products’. As my duty, I need to recall all items sold in both areas as soon as possible. Therefore, I ask Bloomberg Core Financial Apps for the data about specific people who bought the ‘ItemX’ on ‘DateX’.Then I used those data to alert those people by sending email or message. But since the data only includes customers from Large-scale chains supermarket, how to alert people who didn’t leave a clue or data is a problem beyond me.


## weekly status report
* Week behind:
  * Sketched preliminary system diagram and identified key actors/wedges
  * Traveled to Bloomberg office and met with Company Champion and three other Bloomberg individuals interested in the challenge
  * Set up weekly conference calls with Company Champion; we plan on pitching fully-fleshed idea to the Bloomberg team within the next month
  * Signed CSP-CE
  * Set up Github, Slack, and Dropbox for the team’s communication           
* Week ahead:
  * We will scope the problem and commit to the aspect on which we want to direct our focus
  * We will discuss what is the most effective way of solving the problem (mobile apps, web apps, combo of mobile with web)
  * Deeper dive on what the FDA currently offers – how can we build off pre-existing systems?
* Risks:
  * Issue can be approached from many different angles, we need to focus on one single approach and commit to it
  * Massive amount of data out there (consumer data from loyalty programs, recall data from FDA, media reports on the issue) – how to analyze and parse relevant data and make it useful for our project?
