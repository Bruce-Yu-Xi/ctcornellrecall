### Plan for next week
* Solidify product idea, review with Bloomberg stakeholders
* Architecture diagram to be finalized
### Key learnings and actions from your weekly retro
* Company stakeholder confirmed our idea to partner with supermarkets was viable
* Technical process has begun

### Risks
* Still need to discuss and decide on POS partnership idea - need to run by Bloomberg stakeholders
* Architecture diagram still in works - still risk that a major technical roadblock appears
