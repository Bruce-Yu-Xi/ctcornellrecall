##Notes from Crit Session

Samsung
Receipt-hop

Efficiency a second concern
Large set of data

Merge 
Multiple representations of the same data
Different IDs with customer memory

Trim down FDA recall
ID of recall
ID of product
Match with product and customer ID
ID refers to both other tables 
No advantage of NoSQL
Don’t need double indexing

Mobile Aspect small
Update tables
Store large amounts of backend
RDS vs Mobile Hub

Make sure people wanted to use it
Look at producer perspective  risk
Drugs easier to track through prescriptions
Lookup API for Items
These are IDs you can inform about recalls
They are wasting all of their times talking

What are we compromising
2-sided value proposition
